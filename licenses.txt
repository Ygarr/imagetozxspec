Image To ZX Spec is licensed under the GPLv3 but uses open source third party components that are covered by a 
number of other GPLv3 compatible legal licences and copies of which are included in this distribution.

Due to the nature of Java executable jar packaging and for use in Java webstart to simplify distribution 
the third party components - pre-compiled classes - have been copied into the single distributed jar file, 
but the classes are otherwise identical to their respective "binary" .jar file distributions.

The third party licences are as follows:

Note that JFFMPEG's OGG/Vorbis packages are not linked/included (or required) in this code base.

As part of the Java API, JMF should fall under the GPLv3 System Library exception but for avoidance of doubt a 
Section 7 exception is also granted to Image To ZX Spec to allow this library to be linked under its own licence:
